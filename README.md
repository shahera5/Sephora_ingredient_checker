## Introduction

In the beauty and skincare industry, it's important to be aware of the ingredients present in the products we use. Sephora Ingredient Checker
filters a massive list of Sephora products to create a list which contains products without specific ingredients (e.g. Parfum or Talc). Ingredients such as these can cause skin
conditions such as eczema, acne, rosacea, etc.

## Features

- **List of products without specific ingredients** Many times we want to know if there are products which don't have a specific ingredient we're allergic to. Enter the specific ingredients you don't want in your products.
- **Search by Product Name:** Enter the name of a product sold by Sephora to go through the resulting list to see if the product is the specific-ingredient free.
- **Ingredient list** Get the information on the other ingredients for the products in the list.
